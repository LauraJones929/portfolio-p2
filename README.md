### Manual Testing
Manual testing was carried out once the main features of the game had been implemented onto the webpage. After deploying the page early on in the project, I was able to use my iPhone to do manual testing across Google Chrome for iOS and Safari, as well as constant testing on desktop via Chrome Dev Tools.

Upon the first test I noticed that the background image was not showing on either mobile browsers, however the image was showing on the desktop.
Also, on Google chrome the buttons (game.html) css styling was not being applied, but was on Safari.
