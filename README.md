Love Leaves - Live Game Application
View Live Site

## Business Objectives
I have created an online game that is targeted towards children of primary education ages (5-11 yrs). After working in a primary school for the past 8 years I have a good idea of the curriculum and what apps and games come in useful for children's learning. I have seen children use apps and online games to advance their learning in every subject. One lesson that stood out for me over the years was a Science lesson where the children would have to identify the leaves from different trees. They would go out with a clipboard, work sheet with various pictures of leaves on and they would have to find that type of tree in the school garden.
The game I have created would allow the children to take their learning further and implement that knowledge.

I have chosen to use a mobile first approach as children have better access mobile devices and tablets rather than desktops.
The webpage is also easier to navigate on a mobile design as the children don't have to think using a mouse or keyboard to play.

## User Stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
- "As a first time visitor, I want to know what the game is about when first landing on the page, for my child to use."
- "As a first time visitor, I want my child to be able to access the game quickly through the click of a single button."
- "As a first time visitor, I want to test my knowledge of various trees."

### Returning Visitor Goals
- "As a returning visitor, I want to attempt to beat my previous score."
- "As a returning visitor, I want my child to continue to improve their knowledge on different trees."

### Frequent Visitor Goals
- "As a frequent visitor, I like to try to beat my previous scores."
- "As a frequent visitor, I want to use the links on each answer button to find out more information about each tree."


## Design

### Colour Scheme
The main colours for this project are tones of green and cream, to match the theme of the application (nature/trees/leaves). The elements consisting mainly of: **#dedcb5** and **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)**.
- The background image is an image of a green hedge with yellow tones coming through as well as darker shadow tones, so finding the right colour for the foreground elements was important so that it didn't clash with the background image.
- The 'Love Leaves' heading uses **#dedcb5** with a text shadow of **5px**.
The 'Play' and 'Next' buttons use Bootstrap's 'btn-warning' class (yellow), with the text using 'black'.
- The question container uses a background colour of **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)** and a text colour of **#dedcb5**.
- Button elements use the **#dedcb5** to tie in with the question text.
- The score container uses **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)** and the text inside uses **#dedcb5**, again with a text shadow (black).



### Typography
- Fonts are imported into the CSS file via Google Fonts.
- I chose to use 2 fonts - **Indie Flower** and **Dongle**.

### Manual Testing
Manual testing was carried out once the main features of the game had been implemented onto the webpage. After deploying the page early on in the project, I was able to use my iPhone to do manual testing across Google Chrome for iOS and Safari, as well as constant testing on desktop via Chrome Dev Tools.

Upon the first test I noticed that the background image was not showing on either mobile browsers, however the image was showing on the desktop.
Also, on Google chrome the buttons (game.html) css styling was not being applied, but was on Safari.
