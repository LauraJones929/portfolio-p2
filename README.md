Love Leaves - Live Game Application

## Business Objectives
I have created an online game that is targeted towards children of primary education ages (5-11 yrs). After working in a primary school for the past 8 years I have a good idea of the curriculum and what apps and games come in useful for children's learning. I have seen children use apps and online games to advance their learning in every subject. One lesson that stood out for me over the years was a Science lesson where the children would have to identify the leaves of different trees. They would go out with a clipboard, work sheet with various pictures of leaves on and they would have to find that type of tree in the school garden.
The game I have created would allow the children to take their learning further and implement that knowledge.

### Manual Testing
Manual testing was carried out once the main features of the game had been implemented onto the webpage. After deploying the page early on in the project, I was able to use my iPhone to do manual testing across Google Chrome for iOS and Safari, as well as constant testing on desktop via Chrome Dev Tools.

Upon the first test I noticed that the background image was not showing on either mobile browsers, however the image was showing on the desktop.
Also, on Google chrome the buttons (game.html) css styling was not being applied, but was on Safari.
