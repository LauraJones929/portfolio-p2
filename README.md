# Portfolio Project 2 - HTML / CSS / JavaScript
## Love Leaves - Live Game Application
[View Live Site](https://laurajones929.github.io/portfolio-p2/)

## Business Objectives
I have created an online game that is targeted towards children of primary education ages (5-11 yrs). After working in a primary school for the past 8 years I have a good idea of the curriculum and what apps and games come in useful for children's learning. I have seen children use apps and online games to advance their learning in every subject. One lesson that stood out for me over the years was a Science lesson where the children would have to identify the leaves from different trees. They would go out with a clipboard, work sheet with various pictures of leaves on and they would have to find that type of tree in the school garden.
The game I have created would allow the children to take their learning further and implement that knowledge.

I have chosen to use a mobile first approach as children have better access mobile devices and tablets rather than desktops.
The webpage is also easier to navigate on a mobile design as the children don't have to think using a mouse or keyboard to play.

## Mockup

# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
### **First Time Visitor Goals**
- "As a first time visitor, I want to know what the game is about when first landing on the page, for my child to use."
- "As a first time visitor, I want my child to be able to access the game quickly through the click of a single button."
- "As a first time visitor, I want to test my knowledge of various trees."

### **Returning Visitor Goals**
- "As a returning visitor, I want to attempt to beat my previous score."
- "As a returning visitor, I want my child to continue to improve their knowledge on different trees."

### **Frequent Visitor Goals**
- "As a frequent visitor, I like to try to beat my previous scores."
- "As a frequent visitor, I want to use the links on each answer button to find out more information about each tree."


## Design

### **Colour Scheme**
The main colours for this project are tones of green and cream, to match the theme of the application (nature/trees/leaves). The elements consisting mainly of: **#dedcb5** and **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)**. I wanted the colours to be bright and eye-catching to hold the users' attention, baring in  mind that the target audience is children of a primary education age, the colours should be bright, bold and fun.

I used the [Coolors Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to test these colours. I chose to go ahead and continue to use these colours as the result was 'good' when using large text. Also the shadow effect on the text makes it stand out a lot more against the green.

- The background image is an image of a green hedge with yellow tones coming through as well as darker shadow tones, so finding the right colour for the foreground elements was important so that it didn't clash with the background image.
- The 'Love Leaves' heading uses **#dedcb5** with a text shadow of **5px**.
- The question container uses a background colour of **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)** and a text colour of **#dedcb5**.
- Button elements use the **#dedcb5** to tie in with the question text.
- The score container uses **rgb(54,112,45, 0.6)** and the text inside uses **#dedcb5**, again with a text shadow (black).
- The 'Play' button uses Bootstrap's 'btn-warning' class (yellow), with the text using 'black'.

### **Typography**
Fonts are imported into the CSS file via Google Fonts.

The font styles that I have chosen have a fun yet simple characteristic feel to them, so the user can easily read the text if they are of a younger age.
- 'Indie Flower'
- 'Dongle'

The main heading/title and the 'Play' button uses the 'Indie Flower' as I think the first impression when entering the webpage should have a fun, welcoming feel to it.

Other text such as the question and the buttons use 'Dongle'. This font is easier to read as it is more simplistic but still has an element of childishness to it.

## Wireframes

Below are 3 links to show the initial drafts for each screen size. They show how I expect the responsivity between devices to go and how the structure of each page will look.

The project is designed with a mobile first approach. I felt this was more appropriate as the game is aimed at children for educational purposes.

- Multi Device Mockup Generator (techsini) - To create an image of what the project will look like on various devices. TechSini.com
- Coolors Contrast Checker - To test colours throughout the site for whether or not they will produce good user experience.
- W3C Markup Validator - To check for any HTML or CSS errors.

## Testing

Most testing was carried out via Google Chrome browser and Chrome Dev Tools for responsivity and checking to see if the JavaScript code was working as expected, throughout the process of building the project. I also tested the site on an iPhone 12 for responsivity, this included Google Chrome and Safari browsers.


### **Manual Testing**

Manual testing was carried out once the main features of the game had been implemented onto the webpage. After deploying the page early on in the project, I was able to use my iPhone to do manual testing across Google Chrome for iOS and Safari, as well as constant testing on desktop via Chrome Dev Tools.

Upon the first test I noticed that the background image was not showing on either mobile browsers, however the image was showing on the desktop.
Also, on Google chrome the buttons (game.html) css styling was not being applied, but was on Safari.

- Landing Page
    - The background image is visible and centered to create the desired "nature" look.
    - 'Play' button sits underneath the game title as takes user to the game page when clicked.

- Game Page
    - The first question is shown when the page loads.

- Question Images
    - The image changes when the user gets an answer right, ready for the next question.

- Answer Buttons
    - When a button is clicked correctly, it turns green and the user is directed to the next question, with a new image and new arrangement of answers.
    - When a button is clicked incorrectly, it turns red and the user is given further chances until answered correctly. (As this game is intended for young children, I wanted to keep answering the questions as simple as possible for learning purposes.)
